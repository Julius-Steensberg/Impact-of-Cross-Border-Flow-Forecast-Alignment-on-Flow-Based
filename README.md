## üîç Overview

This study investigates how the accuracy and granularity of cross-border flow forecasts affect outcomes in day-ahead electricity markets under a Flow-Based Market Coupling (FBMC) regime. The simulation framework replicates realistic operational processes and analyzes both physical feasibility and economic efficiency under different forecast strategies.

### The framework includes:
- D-2 Common Grid Model (CGM) with DC-OPF optimization  
- Flow-based domain calculation (RAM/PTDF)  
- D-1 market coupling economic dispatch  
- D-1 CGM feasibility check via DC load flow  
- Forecast models for Net Positions (NP) and Power Transfer Corridors (PTC)

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use the Framework

### 1. Generate Training Data
Run:
```bash
D-2_base_case_D-1_MC.py
model_D-1_CGM.py
```
This simulates the perfect foresight pipeline and generates D-1 outputs for training.

### 2. Train Forecast Models
Use:
```bash
Neural_Network_NP.py       # For NP forecasting
Neural_Network_PTC.py      # For PTC forecasting
```
Model outputs are stored in the `ML_results/` directory.

### 3. Run Scenario Pipelines

#### Forecast-Based Scenarios
```bash
full_pipeline_after_NN_NP.py        # With NP forecasts  
full_pipeline_after_NN_PTC.py       # With PTC forecasts
```

#### Perfect Forecast Scenarios
```bash
full_pipeline_after_NN_NP_perfect.py
full_pipeline_after_NN_PTC_perfect.py
```

#### Sensitivity Analysis (Partial Derivatives)
```bash
full_pipeline_after_NN_NP_PD.py
```
