This repository contains the full simulation framework, data, and results associated with the paper:

**"Impact of Cross-Border Flow Forecast Alignment on Flow-Based Market Coupling Efficiency"**  
Submitted to *IEEE Transactions on Power Systems*.

## üîç Overview

The study investigates how the accuracy and granularity of cross-border flow forecasts impact day-ahead electricity market outcomes under a flow-based market coupling (FBMC) mechanism.

It reproduces the full FBMC pipeline including:
- D-2 CGM DC-OPF optimization
- FB domain construction (RAM/PTDF)
- D-1 Market coupling
- D-1 CGM feasibility check
- Forecast models for NP and CB flows
